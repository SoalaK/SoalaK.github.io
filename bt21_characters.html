          <h2 id="Ch1">RJ</h2>
          <p>Jin's contribution RJ is an alpaca who often wears a parka, because he gets cold easily. Jin was drawing cute alpaca doodles for years before this collaboration, so he was excited to finally bring one to life. The other members also say he looks like an alpaca, especially when he eats.</p>
          <p>RJ was taken away by TATA to join BT21. They were an alter-ego, DJ. RJ loves eating, and can commit to gluttony, especially when it comes to eating bread. Even though they originated from Machu Picchu and had to donate their fur back then, they hate shaving.</p>

          <h2 id="Ch3">Mang</h2>
          <p>J-Hope's character Mang is a dancing pony, but he keeps his face hidden by wearing a mask. His nose is heart-shaped, because J-Hope's lips form a heart when he laughs. There are several meanings to 'mang' in Korean. It can translate as 'a pony', 'to fail', and it's the latter part of the word 'hope' (huimang).</p>
          <p>MANG is a purple creature-alike wearing a light-blue horse mask. Their horse mask has a pink heart-shape nose, an indigo hair, and long string with a short indigo tail attached to the bottom of the hair. Mang is evidently identified as non-binary or gender neutral as they had chosen to go in between the male and female toilet doors during the BT21 discussion video. Mang can also be genderfluid, as they shift between the pronouns 'she' and 'he' in various descriptions.</p>
